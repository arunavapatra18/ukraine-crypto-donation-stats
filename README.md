This is a simple react app which displays the current amount of cryptocurrency available in the Ukraine Government's given crypto wallets for donation.

It uses the following APIs to get the wallet address data:
  * [ethplorer.io](https://ethplorer.io/) 
  * [blockchain.info](https://www.blockchain.com/)

Its purely made for the sake of information sharing. Donation is individual choice.

Let's hope for ***PEACE!***
